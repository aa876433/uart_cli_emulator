# UART CLI Simulator Library


Overview
This C library offers a comprehensive framework for developing a UART-based Command Line Interface (CLI) simulator. It is tailored for use in environments where UART communication is integral, such as embedded systems or devices requiring serial management capabilities.

Features
Real-time Input Processing: Manages UART input in real-time, including navigation through input with arrow keys, deletion, and insertion.
Command Completion: Provides tab-completion for commands based on partial user inputs.
Command History: Allows users to navigate through their command history using up and down arrow keys. The history is cyclic with a configurable limit on the number of entries.
Command Sorting: Commands are maintained in a sorted order to optimize the command completion process.
